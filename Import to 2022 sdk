Step 1 — Prepare the legacy project

Open your Unity 2019 VRChat project.

Duplicate your project folder as a backup (never work in the only copy).

Open the duplicated project.

Open the scene(s) you want to export.

In the Hierarchy, expand everything and verify nothing is missing in the inspector (null references are okay; just make sure meshes and materials exist).

Step 2 — Strip out unwanted components

We don’t want scripts or SDK objects in the export.

In Hierarchy, select the root GameObject(s) of your scene.

Use Ctrl + A inside the root to select all child objects.

In the Inspector, remove the following components:

All MonoBehaviours (custom scripts, old interaction scripts, etc.)

VRC SDK components (VRC_Trigger, VRC_Station, VRC_AvatarPedestal, etc.)

Any editor-only components (e.g., debug helpers, custom gizmos)

Keep:

MeshFilter / MeshRenderer

SkinnedMeshRenderer

Animator / Animation (clips only)

Colliders

AudioSource (clips only)

Lights

Transforms

Materials & Textures

⚡ Tip: Use the search bar in the Inspector (t:MonoBehaviour) to highlight all scripts in one go.

Step 3 — Fix references

Make sure all materials, textures, meshes, audio clips, and animations are in the Assets/ folder.

If some assets are outside Assets/, drag them in. Unity packages will only export what’s in Assets/.

Step 4 — Create a temporary parent object

Create an empty GameObject at the root of your scene (call it ExportRoot).

Move all remaining hierarchy under this object.

This ensures you can import one prefab-like container in the new project.

Step 5 — Export as UnityPackage

In the Project window, select the folders containing:

Models

Textures

Materials

Animations

Audio

Right-click → Export Package…

In the export window:

Check “Include Dependencies”

Uncheck Scripts and SDK folders manually if they show up

Save the .unitypackage somewhere accessible.

⚡ Tip: You can also export the ExportRoot GameObject as a prefab inside the package, so the hierarchy structure is preserved.

Step 6 — Import into Unity 2022 + SDK3

Open a fresh Unity 2022 LTS project.

Install the latest VRChat SDK3 + UdonSharp.

Import the .unitypackage you exported:

Assets → Import Package → Custom Package

Only check the assets you want (you can deselect redundant files if needed)

Verify:

Meshes render correctly

Animations play

Audio clips are present

Hierarchy matches your original structure

Step 7 — Rebuild logic

Now your project is “blank slate + content”:

Scripts → rebuild in UdonSharp

Teleports, interactions, AI → re-author from scratch

Shaders → reassign or upgrade

Networking → implement cleanly in SDK3

⚡ Optional: Fast-tracking multiple worlds

Repeat the same pipeline for any other VRChat world assets you want to merge.

Keep all exported .unitypackage files separate until you decide which assets go into the new scene.

This way, you can mix and match models, props, and environments without touching legacy scripts.

If you want, I can draft a ready-to-go “export checklist” for any world, which is basically a one-page workflow so you can do multiple exports without missing anything and without touching scripts or SDK components. It’s very handy if you plan to merge multiple sources.

Do you want me to make that checklist?
